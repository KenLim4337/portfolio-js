    Starting as a tester, I grew and took on other responsibilities such as development, data analytics, and managing the entire testing process. During my time with Conversion Kings, I contributed to the deployment and maintenance of over 250 A/B tests and web pages. All deliverables were pixel-perfect, responsive, and cross-compatible between all popular browsers.

    These development works vary widely in complexity, from simple copy changes to full-page redesigns. My role also involved close collaboration with other developers, designers, account managers, and clients. In addition to my role as a developer, I contributed greatly to internal process and documentation. I implemented a standardized user acceptance testing process which reduced project turnaround time and missed bugs by 30%. I also wrote various training manuals to help streamline the on-boarding process for new team members.
