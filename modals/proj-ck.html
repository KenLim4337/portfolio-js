    Conversion Kings is a Conversion Rate Optimization agency specializing in designing, implementing, and analyzing A/B tests for a wide range of clients including Nespresso and Laureate Universities Australia.

    Starting as a tester, I grew and took on other responsibilities such as development, data analytics, and managing the entire testing process. During my time with Conversion Kings, I contributed to the deployment and maintenance of over 250 A/B tests and web pages. All deliverables were pixel-perfect, responsive, and cross-compatible between all popular browsers.

    My work as a developer at Conversion Kings is broad in scope. In addition to developing and managing A/B tests, I have also contributed to several full-site redesigns as a developer and tester. These duties have allowed me to collaborate closely with other developers, designers, account managers, and even clients. 
</p>

<p>
    Another significant aspect of my contributions lie in internal process and documentation. I successfully introduced a standardized user acceptance testing process which reduced project turnaround time and missed bugs by 30%. Additionally, I authored wrote several training manuals to help streamline the on-boarding of new team members.
