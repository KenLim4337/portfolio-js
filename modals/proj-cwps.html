    Civil War Photo Sleuth is a platform used to identify unknown soldiers in portraits from the American Civil War Era. This platform leverages the complementary strengths of human vision and facial recognition algorithms and has garnered several accolades such as Grand Prize Winner of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/microsoft-cloud-ai-research-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Cloud AI Challenge 2018</a> and being published on <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/computer-scientist-who-wants-to-put-name-to-every-face-in-civil-war-photographs-180971754/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Smithsonian Magazine</a>.

    The new dashboard was developed with design best practices in mind. Integrating UX research from both academia and industry, I collaborated with Dr. Kurt Luther and Vikram Mohanty, a PhD. candidate in designing the dashboard. The primary goal of this update was to drive user engagement by providing an easy to use and transparent visual feed for users. A high fidelity protoype was first created on Figma, then transferred to HTML/CSS.

    The prototypes are then sent to beta testers and lab members to acquire further feedback. These feedback are then assessed and the application modified to provide an ideal user experience. After iteration, the new dashboard was implemented on the beta site for Civil War Photo Sleuth using Django.
