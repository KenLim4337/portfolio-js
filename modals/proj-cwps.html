    Civil War Photo Sleuth is a platform used to identify unknown soldiers in portraits from the American Civil War Era. This platform leverages the complementary strengths of human vision and facial recognition algorithms and has garnered several accolades such as Grand Prize Winner of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/microsoft-cloud-ai-research-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Cloud AI Challenge 2018</a> and being published on <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/computer-scientist-who-wants-to-put-name-to-every-face-in-civil-war-photographs-180971754/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Smithsonian Magazine</a>.

    I designed the new dashboard with a focus on design best practices, leveraging insights from both academic and industry UX research. In collaboration with Dr. Kurt Luther and Vikram Mohanty, a PhD candidate, we aimed to enhance user engagement by creating an easy-to-use and transparent visual feed. The process involved creating a high-fidelity prototype on Figma, which was then implemented in HTML/CSS.

    The prototypes were distributed to beta testers and lab members with requests for feedback. Subsequently, I led several design meetings with my collaborators to discuss and analyze the received feedback. This dialogue informed modifications to the application, aimed at optimizing the overall user experience. These discussions were conducted in parallel with the development of the dashboard on Django.

    After several design and development iterations, the updated dashboard was first deployed on the Civil War Photo Sleuth beta site. This initial deployment allowed for a period of stress-testing and fine-tuning before the application was finally released into the production environment.
