<p>
    CoviDash is a Django application I developed as part of the course "User Interface Software" for my graduate studies. Over the course of the semester, I ideated, designed, developed, and subsequently deployed the application using Heroku.
</p>

<p>
    CoviDash is a social application aimed at combatting COVID-19 misinformation via effective dissemination of COVID-19 related fact-checking. To this end, users are able to freely post, fact-check, and discuss various rumours. To achieve this, user accounts as well as various data objects were created using a postgreSQL database. Other features such as a dashboard, notifications, and searching were also implemented to further enrich the user experience.

    However, due to time constraints, certain links and features were not fully fleshed out. Regardless, the application garnered a high distinction for the course.
