    CoviDash is a Django application I developed as part of the course "User Interface Software" for my graduate studies. Over the course of the semester, I ideated, designed, developed, and subsequently deployed the application using Heroku.

<p>
    CoviDash is a social application aimed at combatting COVID-19 misinformation via effective dissemination of pandemic related fact-checking. Users have the freedom to post, fact-check, and engage in discussions on various rumors. To support these functionalities, a postgreSQL database was employed to create user accounts and manage various data objects. Additionally, features like a dashboard, notifications, and search capabilities were integrated to enhance and enrich the overall user experience.
