    Painted backdrops were widely used in portrait photography around the world throughout the 19th century. Studies into these backdrops have yielded insights into practices of early photographers, as well as the complex socio-political factors surrounding the photographers and their subjects. These backdrops have drawn particular interest from historians, art historians, and collectors throughout the entirety of the American Civil War (1861 -- 1865), the first major conflict to be extensively documented via photography, and during which time many new, military-themed backdrops were introduced.

    In Civil War photography research, the painted backdrop can be used as an additional piece of information when inferring a particular subject, photographer, event, or location. By comparing photos with the same backdrop and examining other facts such as uniform features, researchers can narrow down the potential list of photographers, locations, and subjects that can be identified for the photo, even when no other clues exist.

    To address this research gap, we present BackTrace, a reverse image search system that incorporates novel computer vision techniques and user feedback for identifying and clustering painted backdrops of the Civil War. By utilizing image embeddings instead of text descriptions to power search functions, we make the tool usable even on scarcely tagged archives. Given a query photo, BackTrace retrieves photos with the most similar backdrops from the database and displays them for the user to compare. We also provide an interface for users to inspect and compare photos in detail.

</div>
<p>
    We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation, including user studies, logs, and interviews, with nine participants of varying experience in painted backdrop identification. We found that users were able to effectively utilize BackTrace during testing to identify photos with similar backdrops. Users also reported appreciating visual based search more than the textual alternative.

    The application is planned for public deployment summer 2023. The project will also be submitted for publication.
