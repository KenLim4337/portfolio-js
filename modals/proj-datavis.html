    I developed this data dashboard as my final project for a Information Visualization course. The dashboard was developed using plotly dash and is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. The dashboard is designed to allow users to explore the Yelp dataset and gain insights into the data. The dashboard is also designed to be easily extensible to other datasets. To achieve this, various methods of data processing were utilized including data cleaning, data aggregation, and data normalization. The dashboard also incorporates various data visualization techniques such as bar charts, line charts, and boxplots to help fully describe nuances in the dataset.
