    I developed this data dashboard as my final project for a Information Visualization course. The dashboard was developed using plotly dash and is hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Its primary objective is to provide users with a dynamic platform to explore the Yelp dataset and extract meaningful insights.

<p>
    To prepare the data for consumption, I utilized various methods of data cleaning, aggregation, and normalization. The refined data is presented through a diverse set of visualizations, encompassing bar charts, line charts, and box plots, providing a comprehensive portrayal of nuances within the dataset.
