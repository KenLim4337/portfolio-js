<p>During my time at the University of Queensland, I completed courses and completed projects that addressed the following topics:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Programming Languages (Python, Java, C, C#, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Artificial Intelligence
    </li>
    <li>
        Algorithms and Data Structures
    </li>
    <li>
        Database Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Agile Software Project Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Data Mining
    </li>
    <li>
        Front and Back-end Web Development
    </li>
    <li>
        Human Computer Interaction
    </li>
    <li>
        Social Computing
    </li>
    <li>
        Physical Computing
    </li>

<p>Despite my major being in Software Design, I was able to develop a wide gamut of skills that helped be greatly in my professional and current academic endeavours. I also completed my honours thesis in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), exploring the possibility of utilizing asynchronous communication to improve interdisciplinary cooperation.</p>
