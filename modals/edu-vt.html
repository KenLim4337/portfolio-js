<p>My research focuses on Human-AI interaction, a natural progression of my prior background in Human-Computer Interaction. Specifically, I concentrate on combining the respective strengths of computer vision and human intelligence to classify and organize large image collections. This work has been published at <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/HCOMP/article/view/27551">HCOMP 2023</a>, and won the best demo award at the same conference. Additionally, I achieved a Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics to better understand methods in processing and presenting big data.</p>
