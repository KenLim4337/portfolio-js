<p>Apart from my work with the Crowd Intelligence lab, I am also taking the following courses:</p>   

<ul>
    <li>
        Intro to Urban Computing
    </li>
    <li>
        Software Project Management
    </li>
    <li>
        User Interface Software
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Moving forward, I aim to complete more courses related to Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Human Computer Interaction. I would also like to conduct research in the field of Human-AI interaction as I feel it is a natural progression for my Human Computer Interaction background.</p>
