<p>Apart from my work with the Crowd Intelligence lab, I am also taking courses in the following domains:</p>   

<ul>
    <li>
        Data Analytics
    </li>
    <li>
        Data Visualization
    </li>
    <li>
        Big Data
    </li>
    <li>
        Machine Learning (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing)
    </li>
    <li>
        Human Computer Interaction
    </li>
    <li>
        Ethics in Computer Science
    </li>
    <li>
        Software Project Management (Agile)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The focus of my research is in Human-AI interaction as I feel it is a natural progression for my background in Human Computer Interaction. My current work focuses on leveraging various computer vision techniques and technologies to aid in the discovery of unannotated images in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs). Additionally, I am also pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics to better understand methods in processing and presenting data.</p>
